Adventurers who find themselves on the Road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes.
As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions.

- **#1 Grasping**: If you become Grasping, you seek to accumulate gold and precious items above all else, just for the sake of possessing them.
- **#2 Mistrustful**: When your prized possessions start to weigh you down and become a treasure to be guarded, even the good advice of friends appears to mask dubious intentions.
- **#3 Deceitful**: You feel no shame in misleading others with lies and stratagems, as long as your machinations further your ends and corrupted needs.
- **#4 Thieving**: You have discovered that anything you desire can be yours â€” you just have to take it. You have earned the right to take all you want when you sacrificed the love of your peers and your own self-respect.

Travelling afar might be the duty chosen by a messenger, but it carries the risk of never finding a place to fight for.
The Road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?

- **#1 Idle**: It takes a lot to stir Idle adventurers into action. You are easily distracted, and must be cajoled to fully participate in endeavours.
- **#2 Forgetful**: Being Forgetful indicates that you are often daydreaming and absent-minded, and find it difficult to remember even important things.
- **#3 Uncaring**: When you become Uncaring you lose touch with the world outside of yourself. You can’t bring yourself to feel compassion, and quickly lose interest in matters that do not concern you directly.
- **#4 Cowardly**: You care only for your own safety under any circumstances, and will go to any lengths to save yourself when a threat arises.

## Shadow Path
#### Curse of Vengeance

Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult.
As corruption spreads in their spirit, their behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.

- **#1 Spiteful**: You often repay real or imagined wrongs with vicious rudeness. Depending on the provocation, you may simply be very impolite, or downright insulting.
- **#2 Brutal**: You react violently to provocations and show little restraint under most circumstances.
- **#3 Cruel**: You donâ€™t care if your actions cause pain and suffering to others, and are needlessly savage with your enemies.
- **#4 Murderous**: You become Murderous when you start to consider killing as a perfectly natural way to achieve a goal or simply to make things go your way.

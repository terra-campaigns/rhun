## Shadow Path
#### Lure of Power

When individuals are given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage, or stature, they may end up mistaking their own aggrandisement for the greater good of the people they should be guiding or keeping safe.
Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.

- **#1 Resentful**: You risk becoming bitter and angry with the people you ought to lead. You often feel that you risk your life for individuals that fail to see the wisdom of your words.
- **#2 Arrogant**: You donâ€™t miss an opportunity to underline your own importance, often belittling your peers and companions.
- **#3 Overconfident**: Overconfidence denotes overweening pride, a sentiment that blinds you to your own limits and weaknesses. You endeavour to do anything you set your mind upon, regardless of the consequences that might befall others.
- **#4 Tyrannical**: You escalate your actions and desires to the level of a just cause. Your disregard for the lives of others is so profound that you go to any lengths to achieve your ends, regardless of the cost or methods employed to accomplish them. Any dissenting opinion is considered as utter betrayal.

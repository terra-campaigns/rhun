## Shadow Path
#### Lure of Despair

Self-doubt is often the way that the Shadow chooses to reach the heart of those who oppose it.
For they know that the Enemy is strong and terrible and that those they protect are too naive or weak to fend for themselves.
Every day they ask themselves: will my strength be enough to prevail, or will I drag down the innocent in defeat?

- **#1 Troubled**: You feel a sense of disquiet that makes it hard for you to read a situation clearly and offer counsel to others.
- **#2 Wavering**: Caution can be the enemy of action, and when you become Wavering you cannot set your mind upon a choice quickly and effectively. You vacillate between the various options you see before you.
- **#3 Guilt-ridden**: The curse of those who defend others is to feel remorse when their actions go amiss, pushing you to refuse any daring course of action.
- **#4 Fearful**: When you become Fearful you are so beset by worries and concerns that you cannot force yourself to risk doing anything that will potentially endanger yourself and those you care for.

#### Lure of Secrets

Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use, and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools.
Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.

- **#1 Haughty**: You donâ€™t recognise easily the wisdom found in the words and actions of others, and tend to turn aside all advice and offers of help.
- **#2 Scornful**: You treat the propositions of others with disdain, making use of every opportunity to mock them for their presumed inadequacy.
- **#3 Scheming**: You keep your thoughts and intentions to yourself at all times, never giving advice and heeding only your own judgement. You might sometimes agree with the propositions of others, but only to be free to follow your own choices later.
- **#4 Traitorous**: When you become Traitorous you cannot be trusted to keep your word. You are ready to betray your own friends and allies, if it would turn to your advantage.

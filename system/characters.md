## Background

Choose your **Race**.
Some [Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements) are only available to specific **Races**.
You can be: Men, Hobbits, Dwarves, Númenóreans or Elves.

Choose your name and [Background](/system/characters/#background), which encapsulates your **Calling** to adventure.
Each [Background](/system/characters/#background) should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours, and inform your potential knowledge and skills.
It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial [Background](/system/characters/#background) towards unique narratives.

| *d6* | Archetype      | Description `ToR 44-46`                                     |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| *1*  | Captain        | Lead with trust to save the world from ruin                 |
| *2*  | Champion       | Conquer the Shadow with strength, battling foes head-on     |
| *3*  | Messenger      | Warn the Free Peoples against the coming danger             |
| *4*  | Scholar        | Knowledge turns fear into curiosity, guiding you and others |
| *5*  | Tresure Hunter | Recover lost treasures, braving dangers and fell beasts     |
| *6*  | Warden         | Defend the defenseless, even if it means being feared       |

Optionally you can expand your [Background](/system/characters/#background) with *2* **Aspects**.

| *d6*  | *d6* | Aspect      | Description `ToR 67-68`                                                                               |

## Attributes

You have three [Attributes](/system/characters/#attributes) that are used in different circumstances (see [Saves](/system/rules/#saves)).

**Might**: Force, power & fortitude.   
**Wits**: Intuition, Insight & reflexes.   
**Heart**: Resolve, charisma & attunement.  

For each [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) roll *3d6*.
You can swap two results.
These are your permanent [Attributes](/system/characters/#attributes) values.

 </summary>
 Ines rolls for her character's **STR**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **DEX** and a **13** for **WIL**. She decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 STR**, **12 DEX** and **13** **WIL**.
</details>

During play, their values will change.
Sometimes permanently.

## Grit

[Grit](/system/characters/#grit) indicates your ability to avoid getting hurt.
It is lost when you are harmed, and recovered after a few hours' rest.
You start with *1d6* [Grit](/system/characters/#grit), which you re-roll every time you rest.
[Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements) and conditions may change the number of dice you roll.

## Advancements

You start the game with *1* [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements).
Every time you are [Critically Harmed](/system/rules/#critical-harm) you gain a new [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements) if your new permanent [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) is equal or higher than your current number of [Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements).

## Conditions

When you fail to resist the Shadow's influence for the first time you choose or roll a **Shadow Path**.
Then, for each new *Condition* you acquire you progress in your **Shadow Path**.
With the GM, define the mechanical impact of each *Condition*.
If you gain a new *Condition* after having reached *Condition* **#4**, you are lost to the **Shadow**.

| d6  | Shadow Path `ToR 141-142` | Common with     |
| :-- | :------------------------ | :-------------- |
| *1* | Curse of Vengance         | Champion        |
| *2* | Dragon-Sickness           | Treasure Hunter |
| *3* | Lure of Power             | Captain         |
| *4* | Lure of Secrets           | Scholar         |
| *5* | Path of Despair           | Warden          |
| *6* | Wandering Madness         | Messenger       |

#### Curse of Vengeance

Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult.
As corruption spreads in their spirit, their behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.

- **#1 Spiteful**: You often repay real or imagined wrongs with vicious rudeness. Depending on the provocation, you may simply be very impolite, or downright insulting.
- **#2 Brutal**: You react violently to provocations and show little restraint under most circumstances.
- **#3 Cruel**: You don’t care if your actions cause pain and suffering to others, and are needlessly savage with your enemies.
- **#4 Murderous**: You become Murderous when you start to consider killing as a perfectly natural way to achieve a goal or simply to make things go your way.

#### Dragon-Sickness

Adventurers who find themselves on the Road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes.
As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions.

- **#1 Grasping**: If you become Grasping, you seek to accumulate gold and precious items above all else, just for the sake of possessing them.
- **#2 Mistrustful**: When your prized possessions start to weigh you down and become a treasure to be guarded, even the good advice of friends appears to mask dubious intentions.
- **#3 Deceitful**: You feel no shame in misleading others with lies and stratagems, as long as your machinations further your ends and corrupted needs.
- **#4 Thieving**: You have discovered that anything you desire can be yours — you just have to take it. You have earned the right to take all you want when you sacrificed the love of your peers and your own self-respect.

#### Lure of Power

When individuals are given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage, or stature, they may end up mistaking their own aggrandisement for the greater good of the people they should be guiding or keeping safe.
Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.

- **#1 Resentful**: You risk becoming bitter and angry with the people you ought to lead. You often feel that you risk your life for individuals that fail to see the wisdom of your words.
- **#2 Arrogant**: You don’t miss an opportunity to underline your own importance, often belittling your peers and companions.
- **#3 Overconfident**: Overconfidence denotes overweening pride, a sentiment that blinds you to your own limits and weaknesses. You endeavour to do anything you set your mind upon, regardless of the consequences that might befall others.
- **#4 Tyrannical**: You escalate your actions and desires to the level of a just cause. Your disregard for the lives of others is so profound that you go to any lengths to achieve your ends, regardless of the cost or methods employed to accomplish them. Any dissenting opinion is considered as utter betrayal.

#### Lure of Secrets

Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use, and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools.
Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.

- **#1 Haughty**: You don’t recognise easily the wisdom found in the words and actions of others, and tend to turn aside all advice and offers of help.
- **#2 Scornful**: You treat the propositions of others with disdain, making use of every opportunity to mock them for their presumed inadequacy.
- **#3 Scheming**: You keep your thoughts and intentions to yourself at all times, never giving advice and heeding only your own judgement. You might sometimes agree with the propositions of others, but only to be free to follow your own choices later.
- **#4 Traitorous**: When you become Traitorous you cannot be trusted to keep your word. You are ready to betray your own friends and allies, if it would turn to your advantage.

#### Path of Despair

Self-doubt is often the way that the Shadow chooses to reach the heart of those who oppose it.
For they know that the Enemy is strong and terrible and that those they protect are too naive or weak to fend for themselves.
Every day they ask themselves: will my strength be enough to prevail, or will I drag down the innocent in defeat?

- **#1 Troubled**: You feel a sense of disquiet that makes it hard for you to read a situation clearly and offer counsel to others.
- **#2 Wavering**: Caution can be the enemy of action, and when you become Wavering you cannot set your mind upon a choice quickly and effectively. You vacillate between the various options you see before you.
- **#3 Guilt-ridden**: The curse of those who defend others is to feel remorse when their actions go amiss, pushing you to refuse any daring course of action.
- **#4 Fearful**: When you become Fearful you are so beset by worries and concerns that you cannot force yourself to risk doing anything that will potentially endanger yourself and those you care for.

#### Wandering Madness

Travelling afar might be the duty chosen by a messenger, but it carries the risk of never finding a place to fight for.
The Road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?

- **#1 Idle**: It takes a lot to stir Idle adventurers into action. You are easily distracted, and must be cajoled to fully participate in endeavours.
- **#2 Forgetful**: Being Forgetful indicates that you are often daydreaming and absent-minded, and find it difficult to remember even important things.
- **#3 Uncaring**: When you become Uncaring you lose touch with the world outside of yourself. You can’t bring yourself to feel compassion, and quickly lose interest in matters that do not concern you directly.
- **#4 Cowardly**: You care only for your own safety under any circumstances, and will go to any lengths to save yourself when a threat arises.

## Background

Choose your name and [Background](/system/characters/#background), which encapsulates your **Calling** to adventure.
Each [Background](/system/characters/#background) should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours, and inform your potential knowledge and skills.
It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial [Background](/system/characters/#background) towards unique narratives.

| *d6* | Archetype      | Description `ToR 44-46`                                     |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| *1*  | Captain        | Lead with trust to save the world from ruin                 |
| *2*  | Champion       | Conquer the Shadow with strength, battling foes head-on     |
| *3*  | Messenger      | Warn the Free Peoples against the coming danger             |
| *4*  | Scholar        | Knowledge turns fear into curiosity, guiding you and others |
| *5*  | Tresure Hunter | Recover lost treasures, braving dangers and fell beasts     |
| *6*  | Warden         | Defend the defenseless, even if it means being feared       |

Optionally you can expand your [Background](/system/characters/#background) with *2* **Aspects**.

| *d6*  | *d6* | Aspect      | Description `ToR 67-68`                                                                               |

## Attributes

You have three [Attributes](/system/characters/#attributes) that are used in different circumstances (see [Saves](/system/rules/#saves)).

**Prowess**: Force, finesse & fortitude.   
**Insight**: Intuition, wits & reflexes.   
**Resolve**: Confidence, charisma & attunement.  

For each [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) roll *3d6*.
You can swap two results.
These are your permanent [Attributes](/system/characters/#attributes) values.

 </summary>
 Ines rolls for her character's **STR**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **DEX** and a **13** for **WIL**. She decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 STR**, **12 DEX** and **13** **WIL**.
</details>

During play, their values will change.
Sometimes permanently.

## Grit

[Grit](/system/characters/#grit) indicates your ability to avoid getting hurt.
It is lost when you are harmed, and recovered after a few hours' rest.
You start with *1d6* [Grit](/system/characters/#grit), which you re-roll every time you rest.
[Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements) and conditions may change the number of dice you roll.

## Advancements

You start the game with *1* [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements).
Every time you are [Critically Harmed](/system/rules/#critical-harm) you gain a new [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements) if your new permanent [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) is equal or higher than your current number of [Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements).

The list below are examples of a simple framework for their in-game mechanics.

|                   |                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Asceticism        | You do not take *-1d* when rolling for [Grit](/system/characters/#grit) while poorly fed.        |

| Bodyguard         | You can choose to take damage instead of one of your allies.                                     |
| Could be worse    | Your **Prowess** *Trauma Save* is rolled *Enhanced*.                                             |

| Die Hard          | When you reset your *Grit*, roll $+1d$ and sum all the dice you rolled.                          |

| Fast              | You always act before your opposition.                                                           |
| Healer            | You can automatically stabilise an ally with a *Critical Trauma*.                                |
| Henchkeeper       | You automatically succeed acquiring non-combatant henchmen in a community.                       |
| Ironhide          | When unarmored, your **Armour** is $1$.                                                          |
| Resolute          | Roll $3d6$, if it is higher than your current **Resolve**, take the new result.                  |

| Unyielding        | Your **Resolve** *Trauma Save* is rolled *Enhanced*.                                             |
| Whirlwind         | You are proficient in fighting in melee with two weapons (the off-hand weapon rolls *Impaired*). |

## Conditions

[Conditions](/system/characters/#conditions) are detrimental mechanically, but not necessarily negative in the narrative.
The list below can be used as a starting point.
With the GM you can adapt these or create new ones.

- **Fear-Driven Vigilance**: Fear instills a heightened sense of vigilance, making you more cautious. In situations related to the your fear, you are [Impaired](/system/rules/#roll-modifiers).
- **Obsessive Focus**: Your single-minded pursuit leads to significant personal development and expertise in a specific area, in detriment of others. Swap 1d6 in two [Attributes](/system/characters/#attributes), randomly.
- **Moral Reservations**: Your steadfast morality leads to a firm stance on certain issues. Your actions that go against your moral code are [Impaired](/system/rules/#roll-modifiers).
- **Compulsive Honesty**: You vow to always speak the truth.
- **Kleptomaniac**: You are unable to resist urges to steal items that you generally don't really need.
- **Battle-Scarred**: After some injury, you develop a scar. You might have lost part of a member, an eye, or something else that impacts you physically, intellectually or socially.
- **Protective Instinct**: You are genuinely concerned with your team's welfare, and become a reluctant leader. When an ally is in danger, you are [Impaired](/system/rules/#roll-modifiers).
- **Estranged**: You lose the bond with someone you love or cherish. With the GM, agree the mechanical impact.
- **Slow**: You always act after your opponents.

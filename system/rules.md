## Saves

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.
PCs roll a *d20* for an appropriate ability score.
If they roll equal to or under that ability score, they pass.
Otherwise, they fail.
In a contest, the highest successful roll wins.

 </summary>
 _Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a *d20*, and resulting in a 10 â€“ a success!_

## Combat

#### Attacking

The attacker rolls their weapon die.
The weapon die is an exploding die: if you roll the highest value, roll again and sum the results.
If the result is equal to or under the appropriate 
**Attribute**, subtract the result from the target's **Armour**, then deal the remaining total as Harm.

#### Multiple Attacks

If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all attack dice and keep the single highest result.
If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both dice dice and keep the highest.

#### Blast

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character.
Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite.
If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

#### Initiative & Retreat

Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make an **Wits** save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful **Wits** save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Roll Modifiers

In some circumstances your roll is **Impaired** or **Enhanced**.
When **Impaired** you roll your dice twice, and take the worst result.
When **Enhanced** you roll your dice twice and take the best result.

## Harm

Harm is taken from Grit.
Harm that reduces a target's Grit below 0 decreases the remainder from

- **Might**, for physical harm.
- **Heart**, for the **Shadow**.

They must then make an [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) Save to avoid **critical harm**.
Some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a **critical harm** save.

### Critical harm

When **critically harmed** on

- **Might**, you are **unconscious** and **die** if it goes to *0.
- **Heart**, you gain a **Shadow condition** and are lost to the **Shadow** if it goes to *0*.

If left to your own devices you die within the hour.

When the scene ends, re-roll the affected [Attribute](/system/characters/#attributes) and keep the lowest as its new value. If it is equal or higher then your number of [Advancements](/system/characters/#advancements), they can choose an additional [Advancement](/system/characters/#advancements).

### Recovery

Resting for a few hours and having a meal allow you to re-roll your **Grit**.
Attribute loss can usually be restored at a rate of one per day, if facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
**Deprived** PCs roll *-1d6* **Grit** when resting and do not recover Attributes.

## Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**.
When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).
Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

## Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
| :-----: | :--: | :-----: | :--: | :-----: |
|    2    | 3-5  |   6-8   | 9-11 |   12    |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |

## Morale

Enemies must pass a **Heart** save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
Some groups may use their leader's **Heart** in place of their own.
Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 **Grit**.
Morale does not affect PCs.

## Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll *1d6*.

## Heirs

If you are not Critically Harmed and have an heir that is known to your company, you can decide it is your last scene.
When you do that, choose a song and then re-roll your *Grit*.
For this scene all your rolls are *Enhanced*.
By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, Etc.).
Your heir can now be part of your company, and starts with half (rounded down) the number of *Advancements* you previously had.

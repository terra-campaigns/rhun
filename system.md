### Archetypes

You are defined by an *Archetype*, which encapsulates your **Calling** to adventure`.
Each *Archetype* should offer an immediate grasp of your identity and behaviours.
It is expected you will evolve beyond these initial *Archetypes* towards unique narratives.

| d6  | Archetype      | Description `ToR 44-46`                                     | Favourite *Attributes* |

### Attributes

There are $6$ *Attributes* that you can use to overcome obstacles.

- **Intuition**: track targets, understand creatures, care, survive.
- **Reason**: concentrate, think abstractly, build knowledge.
- **Finesse**: dextrous manipulation, precision, subtle misdirection.
- **Exertion**: apply physical force and power, melee.
- **Psyche**: get in the flow and tune the arcane or technology.
- **Influence**: compel obedience, socialise, influence.

Each *Attribute* has a rating (from $0$ to $4$) that determine how many **Light Dice** to roll when performing *Risky Actions.*
On the character sheet, their ratings are read horizontally.

*Saves* are groupings of two *Attributes* each.

- **Evasion** groups **Intuition** and **Reason**.
- **Fortitude** groups **Finesse** and **Exertion**.
- **Resolve** groups **Psyche** and **Influence**

*Saves* also have ratings (from $0$ to $2$) that determine how many dice to roll in a *Reaction* situation.
On the character sheet, their ratings are read vertically.

#### Determine Attributes  {-}

For each *Save* grouping (**Insight**, **Prowess**, and **Resolve**) roll $1d$ and consult the table below to determine how many *Attribute* points you have to distribute for each.

|                    | $1:3$ | $4:5$ | $6$ |
| :----------------- | :---: | :---: | :-: |
| *Attribute* points |  $1$  |  $2$  | $3$ |

Finally, choose a Favourite *Attribute* from your *Archetype* and assign it an additional point.

In certain conditions, you might permanently lose *Attribute* points, this is discussed in other sections.

#### Example: Scuff's Attributes {-}

![](https://i.imgur.com/bnKfumi.png)


Scuff has an **Attunement** *Attribute* rating of $3$ (read horizontally).
They roll $3d$ when performing a Risky Action related to **Attunement**.
They also have **Influence** $0$ (horizontally), so they roll $0d$ (i.e. no chance if no advantage is found).
If their **Resolve** is challenged, they may roll a *Reaction* with $1d$, based on their **Resolve** *Save* rating (read vertically).

### Grit & Ego

> *"It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward"*
> (Rocky Balboa)

While *Grit* represents your disposition, *Ego* represents your resilience to keep pushing.
Roll $1d$ to determine your *Grit* and *Ego.*
Advancements and conditions may change the number of dice you roll.

#### Trauma {-}

You lose *Grit* when you are harmed.
When your *Grit* reaches $0$ you start marking *Trauma* tracks.
You have $3$ *Trauma* tracks: Stressed ($-1d$ **Insight**), Broken ($-1d$ **Prowess**) and Weary ($-1d$ **Resolve**).
When all three *Wound* tracks are marked, you become *Mortally Wounded*.

While *Mortally Wounded* you cannot gather *Light Die* for your *Risky Actions*.
You will die instantly if harmed further, or in minutes if not attended to.
If you survive being *Mortally Wounded*, you develop a *Malaise*.
Roll $1d$ and consult the table below.
With the GM, describe it narratively.

|     | *Malaises*                                                                         |
| :-: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1$ | No *Malaise*.                                                                      |
| $2$ | $-1$ **Prowess**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $3$ | $-1$ **Insight**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $4$ | $-1$ **Resolve**, you die if it goes below $0d$.                                   |
| $5$ | When you re-roll your *Ego,* use $-1d$ from now on. You die if it goes below $0d$. |
| $6$ | Re-roll your *Grit* with $-1d$ from now on. You die if it goes below $0d$.         |

After a well fed and rested night, you roll and reset your *Grit* ($1d$).
If you did not rest well you have $-1d$ to roll for *Grit*.
Each *Wound* track recovers through appropriate care and a week's rest.
A *Malaise* never recovers.

#### Pushing yourself {-}

You spend *Ego* when you push beyond yourself in *Risky Actions*.
When your *Ego* reaches $0$ you are lost somehow.
With the GM determine how your last scene goes.

< ADAPT BELOW FOR RHUN>

Any time you *Fail* in a *Risky Action* you may choose to suffer a **Panic Event**.
When you do so, roll your Ego die ($1d$) and consult the table below.

|       | Outcome                                                                                  |
| :---: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | Reset your *Ego* to $1:3$. You **Flight**, compelled to leave the scene.                 |
| $4:5$ | Reset your *Ego* to $4:5$. You **Freeze**, silently or otherwise.                        |
|  $6$  | Reset your *Ego* to $6$. You **Fight**, obsessed with being successful during the scene. |

Describe the outcome narrativelly.
In any case, after the scene ends, you gain a *Condition*.
With the GM, determine the mechanical effects and how to introduce your *Condition* into the narrative.

#### Example: Scuff's scuffs {-}

![](https://i.imgur.com/IYdZoZh.png)


Scuff has $1d$ for both *Grit* and *Ego* (usual for early characters).
They have seen some harm, having lost $3$ *Grit* (from $5$ to $2$) and taken a **Hazed** wound.
This means that any time they roll related to **Insight** (**Intuition** or **Reason** for *Risky Actions*, or **Evasion** *Reaction*), they take $-1d$.

Scuff also risked their *Ego* a few times, and took a **Condition** to reset it (from 2 to 4).
Finally, they have gotten a malaise at some point, having reduced their **Exertion** *Attribute* rating because of a weakened lower back.

### Advancements

As you become more seasoned, you gain *Advancements*.
Some *Advancements* are only available to specific races.
Choose your Race.
You start the game with $1$ *Advancement*.

For every session you play (and survive) you gain $+2$ *Experience*.
You also gain $+1$ *Experience* for each new *Condition* you develop.

Whenever it is narratively coherent, you may spend *Experience* equal to $2\times$ your current number of *Advancements* to gain a new one.

| Advancement (Race)                                                                                                                       | Description `ToR 80-89`                                                                     |

| Mastery                                                                                                                                  | When **Hazed** you do not take the penalty of $-1d$.                                        |
| Dour-Handed                                                                                                                              | In melee combat, when you are successful, select an additional die as a second effect.      |

| Prowess                                                                                                                                  | Gain $1$ in an *Attribute*. The maximum you can have in all *Attributes* together is $10$.  |

### Conditions

When you fail to resist the Shadow's influence for the first time you choose or roll a **Shadow Path**.
Then, for each new *Condition* you acquire you progress in your **Shadow Path**.
With the GM, define the mechanical impact of each *Condition*.
If you gain a new *Condition* after having reached *Condition* **#4**, you are lost to the **Shadow**.

| d6  | Shadow Path `ToR 141-142` | Common with     |
| :-- | :------------------------ | :-------------- |
| $1$ | Curse of Vengance         | Champion        |
| $2$ | Dragon-Sickness           | Treasure Hunter |
| $3$ | Lure of Power             | Captain         |
| $4$ | Lure of Secrets           | Scholar         |
| $5$ | Path of Despair           | Warden          |
| $6$ | Wandering Madness         | Messenger       |

#### Curse of Vengeance

Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult.
As corruption spreads in their spirit, their behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.

- **#1 Spiteful**: You often repay real or imagined wrongs with vicious rudeness. Depending on the provocation, you may simply be very impolite, or downright insulting.
- **#2 Brutal**: You react violently to provocations and show little restraint under most circumstances.
- **#3 Cruel**: You don’t care if your actions cause pain and suffering to others, and are needlessly savage with your enemies.
- **#4 Murderous**: You become Murderous when you start to consider killing as a perfectly natural way to achieve a goal or simply to make things go your way.

#### Dragon-Sickness

Adventurers who find themselves on the Road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes.
As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions.

- **#1 Grasping**: If you become Grasping, you seek to accumulate gold and precious items above all else, just for the sake of possessing them.
- **#2 Mistrustful**: When your prized possessions start to weigh you down and become a treasure to be guarded, even the good advice of friends appears to mask dubious intentions.
- **#3 Deceitful**: You feel no shame in misleading others with lies and stratagems, as long as your machinations further your ends and corrupted needs.
- **#4 Thieving**: You have discovered that anything you desire can be yours — you just have to take it. You have earned the right to take all you want when you sacrificed the love of your peers and your own self-respect.

#### Lure of Power

When individuals are given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage, or stature, they may end up mistaking their own aggrandisement for the greater good of the people they should be guiding or keeping safe.
Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.

- **#1 Resentful**: You risk becoming bitter and angry with the people you ought to lead. You often feel that you risk your life for individuals that fail to see the wisdom of your words.
- **#2 Arrogant**: You don’t miss an opportunity to underline your own importance, often belittling your peers and companions.
- **#3 Overconfident**: Overconfidence denotes overweening pride, a sentiment that blinds you to your own limits and weaknesses. You endeavour to do anything you set your mind upon, regardless of the consequences that might befall others.
- **#4 Tyrannical**: You escalate your actions and desires to the level of a just cause. Your disregard for the lives of others is so profound that you go to any lengths to achieve your ends, regardless of the cost or methods employed to accomplish them. Any dissenting opinion is considered as utter betrayal.

#### Lure of Secrets

Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use, and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools.
Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.

- **#1 Haughty**: You don’t recognise easily the wisdom found in the words and actions of others, and tend to turn aside all advice and offers of help.
- **#2 Scornful**: You treat the propositions of others with disdain, making use of every opportunity to mock them for their presumed inadequacy.
- **#3 Scheming**: You keep your thoughts and intentions to yourself at all times, never giving advice and heeding only your own judgement. You might sometimes agree with the propositions of others, but only to be free to follow your own choices later.
- **#4 Traitorous**: When you become Traitorous you cannot be trusted to keep your word. You are ready to betray your own friends and allies, if it would turn to your advantage.

#### Path of Despair

Self-doubt is often the way that the Shadow chooses to reach the heart of those who oppose it.
For they know that the Enemy is strong and terrible and that those they protect are too naive or weak to fend for themselves.
Every day they ask themselves: will my strength be enough to prevail, or will I drag down the innocent in defeat?

- **#1 Troubled**: You feel a sense of disquiet that makes it hard for you to read a situation clearly and offer counsel to others.
- **#2 Wavering**: Caution can be the enemy of action, and when you become Wavering you cannot set your mind upon a choice quickly and effectively. You vacillate between the various options you see before you.
- **#3 Guilt-ridden**: The curse of those who defend others is to feel remorse when their actions go amiss, pushing you to refuse any daring course of action.
- **#4 Fearful**: When you become Fearful you are so beset by worries and concerns that you cannot force yourself to risk doing anything that will potentially endanger yourself and those you care for.

#### Wandering Madness

Travelling afar might be the duty chosen by a messenger, but it carries the risk of never finding a place to fight for.
The Road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?

- **#1 Idle**: It takes a lot to stir Idle adventurers into action. You are easily distracted, and must be cajoled to fully participate in endeavours.
- **#2 Forgetful**: Being Forgetful indicates that you are often daydreaming and absent-minded, and find it difficult to remember even important things.
- **#3 Uncaring**: When you become Uncaring you lose touch with the world outside of yourself. You can’t bring yourself to feel compassion, and quickly lose interest in matters that do not concern you directly.
- **#4 Cowardly**: You care only for your own safety under any circumstances, and will go to any lengths to save yourself when a threat arises.

### Equipment 

The following is a list of equipment tags. 

|     Tag     | Description                                       |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
|    $-1d$    | **Improvised**                                    |
|    $-1e$    | **Inefective**: Disadvataged *Effect* is applied. |
| $\emptyset$ | **Base**: No modifications.                       |
|    $+1e$    | **Effective**: Advantaged *Effect* is applied.    |

The table below contains example weapons, and may be expanded with the GM.
For ranges, use what is narratively appropriate.

|    Tags     | Melee Examples          | Ranged Examples        |
| :---------: | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
|    $-1d$    | **Unarmed**             | Throwing **Objects**   |
|    $-1e$    | Dagger, Sword           | Short Spear, Bow       |
| $\emptyset$ | Club, Long Sword, Axe   | Great Spear, Great Bow |
|    $+1e$    | Long/Great Axe, Mattock |                        |

Armours act as buffers when you take damage from *Challenges*.
Subtract the armour modifier from the *Effect* before reducing your *Grit*

| Armour      | Modifier | Details                                            |
| ----------- | :------: | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leather** |   $-1e$  |                                                    |
| **Mail**    |   $-2e$  | $-1d$ to run, observe, sneak, swim, etc.           |
| **Shield**  |   $-1e$  | Can be sacrificed to completely avoid an *Effect*. |

## Rules

### Risky Actions

When you are trying your chances at a *Risky Action*, say what you intend to do.
With the GM determine your appropriate *Attribute* or *Save*.
Then gather 6-sided dice.

|                                | Dice Pool                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](imgs/dice-light-6-sml.png) | Take a number of **Light Dice** equal to your applicable *Attribute* or *Save*. Relevant *Advancements* / *Conditions* may give you $\pm 1d$. You must always roll between $0d$ and $4d$ **Light Dice**. |
| ![](imgs/dice-dark-6-sml.png)  | Take as many **Dark Dice** as you wish to risk *Ego* for pushing yourself for a success. For each **Dark Die** that rolls equal or lower than your current *Ego*, decrease your *Ego* in one.            |

Roll the dice and choose one die to be your *Precision* (generally the highest, but you might choose differently if you wish) and consult the table.

|       | Outcome                                                                                                                                                     |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | You *Fail*, and things get worse. With the GM describe the consequences. The GM may also allow you to succeed, but things will get worse in some other way. |
| $4:5$ | You *Succeed*, but there’s some consequences. If applying *Effects*, they are halved. With the GM describe the complication and how you succeed.            |
|  $6$  | You *Succeed*. With the GM describe what happens.                                                                                                           |

*Risky Actions* may be used when you are working on something time consuming.
This favours pacing of the game.

### Challenges

Sometimes, multiple actions are required to overcome *Challenges*.
Examples of *Challenges* are

- fighting an enemy,
- duelling rhetorically,
- negotiating an environment,
- crawling a location,
- journeying.

#### Effects {-}

*Effects* determines the quantitative result of your *Risky Actions* towards overcoming *Challenges*.
Examples of *Effects* are:

- Damage given,
- Convincing done,
- Distance covered,
- Weakness learned.

When you roll your *Risky Actions*, choose one die to be your *Effect* (generally the second highest, if the highest was used as *Precision*).
The *Effect* die is an exploding die (i.e. if the result is a $6$, keep rolling and accumulating the result).
The *Effect* is modified depending on the approach you take.
Your *Effect* is subtracted from the *Challenge* **Disposition**.

|                             | Approaches                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $-1e$<br>**Disadvantaged**  | Primitive tool<br>Weak argument<br>Small weapons           |
| $\emptyset$<br>**Baseline** | Fit for purpose tool;<br>Good argument; <br>Medium weapons |
| $+1e$<br>**Advantaged**     | Expert grade tool<br>Strong rationale<br>Large weapons     |
#### Tiers {-}

*Challenges* are divided in **Tiers**, which define how much *Effect* they take to be overcame (**Disposition**), and how many *Effect* dice they use (**Dice**).

|                 | Tier           | Examples                                                             |
| --------------- | :------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trivial**     | $1$<br>$d/2$   | Unskilled adversaries, low height climb, known journey               |
| **Dangerous**   | $5$<br>$1d$    | Skilled adversaries, small predator, large prey, troublesome journey |
| **Serious**     | $10$<br>$2d$   | Expert adversaries, large predator, traverse fire or acid            |
| **Formidable**  | $15$<br>$3d$   | Human prime, apex predator, climbing the Everest                     |
| **Exceptional** | $20+$<br>$4d+$ | Transhuman, often fatal environments, heroic journeys                |

Some challenges might be multifaceted.
A bulky rival might be a Dangerous *Challenge* to fight against, but a Trivial *Challenge* to be convinced to ignore you.

When *Challenge Effects* are applied to you narratively, use the table.

|       | Consequence                                                   |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | Something annoying happens. An uncertain encounter.           |
| $4:5$ | Something troublesome happens. An unfriendly encounter.       |
| $6+$  | Something devastating happens. A hostile encounter.           |
| $12+$ | $6+$ and immediately harmful. A hostile and violent encounter |

When *Challenge* *Effects* are applied to you as damage your *Grit* might be reduced.
Subtract the armour rating from the *Effect*, and then reduce the remainder from your *Grit*.

When you reduce a *Challenge*'s **Disposition** to $0$, you have defeated it for now.
If the *Challenge* is sentient, and has a choice, the GM might roll its **Dice** and consult the **Morale** table below.

|       | Morale                                                                                                |
| :---: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1:3$ | They give up.                                                                                         |
| $4:5$ | They push through, with a lower **Tier**. Reset its **Disposition** and **Dice** to the new **Tier**. |
| $6+$  | They continue with the original **Tier**. Reset its **Disposition**.                                  |

#### Consequences {-}

The following is a non-exhaustive list of consequences.

- Advance trouble
- Reveal an unwelcome truth
- Ask a provocative question
- Put someone on a spot, worsen position or stress
- Use up their resources
- Remove a safety net, cut supply or connection
- Remove a sense
- Hurt someone, directly or collateral
- Separate them
- Capture someone
- Turn their action back on them
- Demonstrate a downside
- Expose a secret
- Offer an opportunity (with a tough choice)
- Tell them the consequences (e.g. create a witness)
- Advance a countdown, progress a new challenge
- Increase risk (roll morale)
- Exploit someone's flaw
- Change the environment
- Provide a choice of paths
- Bar the way, make them go backward
- Hint at more than meets the eye
- Present a discovery
- Point to a looming danger
- Introduce person, faction, danger
- Offer riches at a price

### Fortune die

When the GM wants to leave some decision to the dice, determine the chances and roll $1d$.

### Sayonara

At any moment you can decide it is your last scene.
When you do that, choose a song and then re-roll your *Ego* and *Grit*, keeping the highest values.
For this scene, you only expend *Ego* if you roll a $1$ on **Dark Dice**.
By the end of the scene, you have to figure out how you depart (death, madness, mission, etc.).
You can create a new character with half (rounded up) the number of *Advancements* the previous character had.

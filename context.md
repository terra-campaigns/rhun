## Rhûn

> See [video](https://youtu.be/lAY-NjLrCuY?si=DcWHLwOtNXRxASlX) about Rhûn

An expansive region east of Rhovanion and south of the Iron Hills, inhabited by [**Easterlings**](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Easterlings).
Easterlings, Rhûn's main inhabitants, are known to have various tribes with their own cultures, often portrayed as adversaries to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth during earlier Ages.

## 4th Age

Following the defeat of Sauron, King Elessar (Aragorn) establishes peace and seeks to heal and unify Middle-earth.
However, this peace may not fully extend to all regions, especially those far from Gondor's influence.
After the Elven migration, there is hardly Elves in Middle Earth.
Some Half Elves still exist.

## Ryxgla Gruk'mog {#grukmog}

- **Names**: The Watcher in the Deep, Ryxgla Mb'hoth was the name given to this ancient evil. Among the orcs, it is known as Ryxgla Gruk'mog, a name derived from the words "Gruk" (knowledge and mind) and "mog" (greatness).
- **Origin**: Ryxgla Mb'hoth, the ancient evil, is an ancient entity worshipped by the early men of the east. It resided in the deep caves of the Ryxgla Mountains, revered as a god.
- **Appearance**: A monstrous, toad-like creature with great horns. Its presence is marked by a chilling cold, and it is first seen by its gaping, gasping mouth.
- **History**: Once worshipped, Ryxgla Gruk'mog was abandoned after wars drove out its followers. This abandonment filled it with a deep hatred for the invaders, particularly the Elves and Men who settled the land.
- **Legacy**: In the northern Ryxgla Mountains, a cave bears the inscription of Alegorn's sacrifice, a reminder of the entity's past banishment but not its complete destruction.

# Sea of Rhûn {#seaofrhun}

The Sea of [Rhûn](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Rh%C3%BBn) was located in the west of the land of Rhûn, which was east of Rhovanion and north of Mordor.
The sea also contained a wooded island within the Sea.

There were unnamed highlands on the southwest side of the sea and a beech-forest known as [Neldoreth](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Neldoreth "Neldoreth") on the northeast side.
Northwest of the sea was [Dorwinion](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Dorwinion "Dorwinion"), a land of great gardens, vast vineyards and renowned wines.
The [Kine of Araw](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Kine_of_Araw "Kine of Araw"), wild, white cattle, were known to live near the sea's shores.

**Major nations or groups**

- **Dorwinioners** (Triumph & Justice): Under the banner of Gondor/Rohan.
	- Dorwinion has been flourishing in the Gardens of Dorwinion since the defeat of Sauron.
	- Gondor established institutions focused on justice and righteousness, such that the society’s laws and values are fairly and even-handedly enforced.
	- **Location**: Gardens of Dorwinion, in the West of the region
	- **Historical events**:
		- The group adopted many customs from their neighbours (Vashnars) and many exiled Easterlings joined the group.
		- The group’s former ruling dynasty was recently replaced, through intrigue.
		- New institutions and groups seeking to exploit the rewards of the newfound peace.
		- Righteous crusaders for the cause expand east and south bound.
- **Lôthregars** (Exhaustion / Ignorance): Strong influence from the dark lords, mostly bad clans.
	- The region was depleted by Sauron's armies: spent rivers, barren fields, cut-over forests, and shorn hillsides.
	- The sparse nation that remained is an ignorant one, still believing in Sauron's return.
	- **Location**: Inhabit the South of the region.
	- **Historical events**: 
		- The region is full of vast military estates, where most of Easterlings military prowess was developed. Now all lay in abandon.
		- A vast resource of Morgûl Tar was recently discovered in a collapsed bunker, and they have been trading it with other peoples through the Sea of Rhûn trading route.
		- They’re suspected of backing Kazadorns assassinations.
- **Vashnars** (Enlightenment / Precarity): Hardly any influence from the dark lords left, some are good and were good men. They were mostly inspired by the Blue Wizards.
	- A genuine love of knowledge imbues the nation, such that academies and schools have an important role in social and political life, and a good education is considered a hallmark of gentility.
	- Due to the quality of life that Vashnars have achieved now, Kazadorns are migrating heavily. Societal structure is not appropriate to receive so many migrants.

- **Blacklocks** (Poverty / Unity): Eastern Dwarves (Blacklocks) that migrated to the West, and then came back and reestablished in the Ryxgla mountains
	- The nation is poor. Even aristocrats might not be assured of the necessary staples of life, or basic resources might be constantly threatened by the depths of the mountain, warfare from the East and diseases.
	- Powers and groups within the nation are highly united in their goals and sense of fellowship.
	- **Location**: Ryxgla mountains, in the Southwest.
	- **Historical event**:

- **Orcs** (Decadence / Despair): not a nation, but an important antagonist group.

	- They accept evils and sufferings as inevitable, and the natives will do little to rebel, resist, or defy their unhappy fates.
	- **Location**: Live in Rhûn's pit, in the Southeast, but also on tunnels and caverns under the entire region.
	- **Historical event**:
		- Rulers change very frequently.
		- A powerful new religion arose among the group, the followers of Ryxgla Gruk'mog.

Still have lingering influence from the dark lords, some are good and were good men. Made up of a multitude of tribes, with one warlord elected though challenge.

Tribes are cruelly oppressed by other tribes. Intra tribe oppression is accepted as a commonplace.
The nation is a bloody one, with human life held cheap and death a commonplace. This may be the result of incessant warfare.

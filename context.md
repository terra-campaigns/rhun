## Ryxgla Gruk'mog: The Watcher in the Deep

Ryxgla Mb'hoth was the name given to this ancient evil.
Among the orcs, it is known as Ryxgla Gruk'mog, a name derived from the words "Gruk" (knowledge and mind) and "mog" (greatness).
This fearsome entity is also referred to as The Watcher in the Deep by the orcs of the Ryxgla Mountains.

Ryxgla Gruk'mog has a toad-like form adorned with great horns.
Its presence is preceded by a terrible cold, chilling all who approach.
The first sight one has of it is its gaping mouth, opening and closing as if gasping for air.

For a long time, Ryxgla Gruk'mog dwelt in a deep cave within the Ryxgla Mountains.
The first men from the east revered it and the mountain as a god, offering it sustenance and care.
However, many wars ravaged those territories.
Armies of Elves and Men drove out the men of the east, leaving the entity deprived of its followers.
This abandonment bred an irrepressible hatred in Ryxgla Gruk'mog against the invaders.

In the northern part of the Ryxgla Mountains, a dark cave bears a solemn inscription: "Here Alegorn, son of Alegil, banished the thing from the Abyss but died of his wounds. The elves retrieved his body to return to his family."
This sentence serves as a grim reminder of the entity's lingering presence and the sacrifices made to confront it.

## Main empires

The main empires of the world are descendent kingdoms from the late 3rd Age of Middle Earth.
The elves have mostly left to the undying lands.

## Darkness evil {#evil}


## Ryxgla Gruk'mog: The Watcher in the Deep

Ryxgla Mb'hoth was the name given to this ancient evil.
Among the orcs, it is known as Ryxgla Gruk'mog, a name derived from the words "Gruk" (knowledge and mind) and "mog" (greatness).
This fearsome entity is also referred to as The Watcher in the Deep by the orcs of the Ryxgla Mountains.

Ryxgla Gruk'mog has a toad-like form adorned with great horns.
Its presence is preceded by a terrible cold, chilling all who approach.
The first sight one has of it is its gaping mouth, opening and closing as if gasping for air.

For a long time, Ryxgla Gruk'mog dwelt in a deep cave within the Ryxgla Mountains.
The first men from the east revered it and the mountain as a god, offering it sustenance and care.
However, many wars ravaged those territories.
Armies of Elves and Men drove out the men of the east, leaving the entity deprived of its followers.
This abandonment bred an irrepressible hatred in Ryxgla Gruk'mog against the invaders.

In the northern part of the Ryxgla Mountains, a dark cave bears a solemn inscription: "Here Alegorn, son of Alegil, banished the thing from the Abyss but died of his wounds. The elves retrieved his body to return to his family."
This sentence serves as a grim reminder of the entity's lingering presence and the sacrifices made to confront it.

## Main empires

The main empires of the world are descendent kingdoms from the late 3rd Age of Middle Earth.
The elves have mostly left to the undying lands.

# Sea of Rhûn {#seaofrhun}

> See [video](https://youtu.be/lAY-NjLrCuY?si=DcWHLwOtNXRxASlX) about Rhûn

The Sea of [Rhûn](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Rh%C3%BBn) was located in the west of the land of Rhûn, which was east of Rhovanion and north of Mordor.
The sea also contained a wooded island within the Sea.

There were unnamed highlands on the southwest side of the sea and a beech-forest known as [Neldoreth](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Neldoreth "Neldoreth") on the northeast side.
Northwest of the sea was [Dorwinion](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Dorwinion "Dorwinion"), a land of great gardens, vast vineyards and renowned wines.
The [Kine of Araw](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Kine_of_Araw "Kine of Araw"), wild, white cattle, were known to live near the sea's shores.

Add hills on the SE.

Six major geographical features:

- Highlands (unnamed)
- Neldoreth (forest)
- Sea of Rhûn
- Wooden Island (megaplex - ancient structure)
- Gardens of Dorwinion (ancient farmland)
- Arratu/Badlands?

Six major nations or groups `roll 2 thematic elements WWN 126 for each`

- `2 good tags` Dorwinion, under the banner of Gondor/Rohan - Northmen?
- [Easterlings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Easterlings) - maybe divide in 3 (N, NE, SE) `1 bad tag, one random` some are good and were good men, or influenced by the blue wizards
	- N
	- NE
	- SE
- `1 good tag, 1 bad` One in the mountains? West was conquered by Gondor, dwarves re establishing?
- `2 bad tags` Badlands + Subterranean ruins? Last bastion of orcs?

Most dwarves fled to the west in the end of the 3rd age, and there are hardly any elves in Middle Earth. This leaves Rhûn a mostly human region, with evil dwarves and orcs.

The Blue Wizards have turned the corrupted minds of Easterlings that supported Sauron. Lots of internal strife in the region.

One in the forest - what lives in the forest? To be defined in campaign.

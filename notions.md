## Plot Ideas

- [ ] **Power Struggles:**
	
	- Various tribes and factions within Rhûn vying for dominance after the fall of Sauron. Your players could be involved in these power struggles, either aligning with or against different factions.
- [ ] **Remnants of Sauron's Influence:**
	
	- Hidden cults or remnants of Sauron's followers trying to regain power. Ancient artifacts or strongholds could still harbor dark powers.
- [ ] **Exploration and Diplomacy:**
	
	- Missions to establish trade routes or diplomatic relations between Rhûn and the western kingdoms. This can involve navigating political tensions and potential hostility.
- [ ] **New Threats:**
	
	- Introduction of new or forgotten threats from the East. This could involve mythical creatures, ancient curses, or otherworldly powers.
- [ ] **Resurgence of Ryxgla Gruk'mog:**
	
	- The ancient evil stirs in its deep cave, seeking to reclaim its former power and followers. Strange occurrences, such as sudden cold spells and mysterious disappearances, hint at its awakening.
	- Your players are tasked with investigating these disturbances, leading them to uncover the history of Ryxgla Gruk'mog and its connection to the local legends.
- [ ] **The Cult of the Watcher:**
	
	- A new cult has formed, worshipping Ryxgla Gruk'mog and seeking to restore it to power. They perform dark rituals and sacrifices to gain the entity's favor.
	- The players must infiltrate the cult, gather information, and thwart their plans to prevent the rise of Ryxgla Gruk'mog.
- [ ] **Seeking the Legacy of Alegorn:**
	
	- The inscription about Alegorn mentions his banishment of the creature and the recovery of his body by the Elves. Clues lead the players to seek the descendants of Alegorn or ancient elven texts that may hold secrets to combating Ryxgla Gruk'mog.
	- This quest could involve alliances with elves, delving into ancient ruins, and uncovering forgotten lore.
- [ ] **A United Front:**
	
	- To defeat Ryxgla Gruk'mog, the players must unite the fragmented tribes and factions of Rhûn, appealing to their shared history and the common threat.
	- Diplomatic missions, battles against rival factions, and earning the trust of wary leaders can be central themes.
- [ ] - **The Hidden Island:**
	    
	    - The wooded island in the center of the Sea of Rhûn becomes a focal point. Rumors suggest it holds ancient artifacts or is a place of power connected to Ryxgla Gruk'mog.
	    - Players might need to reach the island, navigating treacherous waters, dealing with hostile creatures, and exploring its depths to uncover its secrets.
- [ ] **Dorwinion's Role:**
	
	- Dorwinion, with its wealth and strategic location, becomes a target for both allies and enemies. The players might need to secure an alliance with Dorwinion to gain resources or political support.
	- Diplomatic missions, protecting vineyards from raiders, and uncovering spies can be key elements here.

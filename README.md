## Toolset

- Obsidian is a good (and free) markdown editor.
- If you dont have something like Obsidian Sync, edits on the fly can also be done using GitHub's webapp.
- When adding images, do not add them directly to the repository, to keep it light. Use Imgur and html links instead. Obsidian has a [plugin](https://github.com/gavvvr/obsidian-imgur-plugin) that does that for you.

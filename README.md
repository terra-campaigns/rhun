# Contribute

Clone this repo, or edit a branch directly from GitHub's webapp.
Look at the list of issues, and choose one to begin with.

Do not make changes on `main`.
Feature branches should be used and merged to `main` through Pull Requests (PR).
PR needs to be approved by another contributor.

The project uses markdown files.
When writing, use a new line for each sentence, and two RETURNS for new paragraphs.
This is better for versioning.

## Toolset

- Obsidian is a good (and free) markdown editor.
- If you dont have something like Obsidian Sync, edits on the fly can also be done using GitHub's webapp.
- When adding images, do not add them directly to the repository, to keep it light. Use Imgur and html links instead. Obsidian has a [plugin](https://github.com/gavvvr/obsidian-imgur-plugin) that does that for you.

### Tips & tricks

If you need to add text that does not get rendered into html, make a new paragraph with:

[This is a comment that will be hidden.]: #
